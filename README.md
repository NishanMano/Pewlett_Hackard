## Overview of the analysis:
Upper-level management required an analysis done on the number of employees who will retire in the upcoming years. They believe that many people will be retiring and wanted to get a grasp on how many people they would need to potentially hire as well as set up a mentorship program prior for younger employees. This would be beneficial for the younger employees to get exposure and advice from senior staff members.

## Results:

- Altogether there are 90 398 employees who are coming up for retirement. There are 29,414 Senior Engineers and 28,254 Senior Staff members retiring. This is quite alarming as 2/3 of the employees retiring are Senior level employees.
- There are many Senior staff members who are eligible for retirement in the upcoming years.
- There are 29,414 Senior Engineers and 28,254 Senior Staff members retiring. This is quite alarming as 2/3 of the employees retiring are Senior level employees.
- There are 1549 employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. This is one positive thing that the company can immediately initiate. 

## Summary

I would suggest starting the mentorship program immediately and find ways to make it so that one person can mentor numerous people at once. 
I would even recommend creating mentorship program videos which they can use even more efficiently as well as improvise as the years go on. 
This will provide at least some valuable insight into their experience in their roles with the younger generation.
They should look into hiring as quickly as possible due to the large disparity in their senior level positions. 
We can always do further research on a yearly basis to find out how much people are retiring for the very next year. 
This would provide insight on how quickly they would need to hire more staff.
